# Overview/TL;DR

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines a new system for gamified idea ranking designed to address the challenge of efficiently prioritizing a large number of ideas. It proposes using pairwise comparisons, where users select the higher potential idea, and applying the Glicko-2 algorithm to calculate reliable ratings. This approach aims to provide a more efficient and trustworthy method for idea prioritization by reducing uncertainty in their assessment.

## Problem Statement & Purpose (The "Why")

Organizations often face the challenge of effectively evaluating and prioritizing a large volume of ideas. The current methods for ranking and sequencing these ideas are frequently inefficient, time-consuming, and can lead to subjective or unreliable outcomes, hindering the ability to quickly identify and act upon high-potential innovations.

### Core User Problem(s)

The primary users affected by this problem are individuals and teams responsible for innovation, product development, and strategic planning, who must sift through numerous ideas to identify those with the highest potential. Specifically, they encounter the following pain points within their current idea evaluation workflows:

*   **Difficulty and Time Consumption:** "Considering large number of ideas is difficult and time-consuming" <sup>[3](https://console.alisx.com/ideate/5c08b691-2dda-49e7-a6d0-d8174785e294/streams/332f01da-5d7d-4cfd-a2fd-71e2e630d3a9#:~:text=Considering%20large,and%20time-consuming)</sup>. Traditional methods, such as requiring users to assign absolute scores to each idea, become unwieldy and burdensome as the volume of ideas grows, leading to user fatigue and inefficiency.
*   **Inefficient Comparison in Large Pools:** "In a large pool, not every idea can be compared against every other idea immediately" <sup>[2](https://console.alisx.com/ideate/5c08b691-2dda-49e7-a6d0-d8174785e294/streams/12a3f7ee-7c4f-4ce9-ab7c-373a42c5f162#:~:text=In%20a,idea%20immediately)</sup>. This limitation prevents a comprehensive and timely assessment of all submitted ideas, creating bottlenecks in the evaluation process and potentially delaying the progression of valuable concepts.
*   **Lack of Confidence in Rankings:** Existing ranking systems often lack a clear, quantifiable measure of confidence or reliability in the generated scores. This absence makes it difficult for decision-makers to fully trust the prioritization outcomes, leading to prolonged discussions and a reluctance to commit resources based solely on the rankings.

### Impact and Significance of the Problem

These challenges have significant negative consequences for both the individuals involved in the process and the broader business objectives:

*   **For Users:** The arduous process of idea evaluation leads to wasted time, increased frustration, and a higher cognitive load. It can also result in decision fatigue, potentially causing valuable ideas to be overlooked or poorly assessed due to the sheer volume and complexity.
*   **For the Business:** Inefficient idea prioritization directly impacts the pace of innovation and strategic execution. It can lead to:
    *   **Missed Opportunities:** High-potential ideas may not be identified quickly enough, delaying market entry or competitive advantage.
    *   **Suboptimal Resource Allocation:** Resources might be misdirected towards less impactful ideas due to unreliable ranking data, leading to inefficient use of budget and personnel.
    *   **Slowed Decision-Making:** The inability to rapidly and confidently prioritize ideas hinders agile development and strategic responsiveness, impacting the organization's ability to adapt to market changes.
    *   **Reduced Return on Investment (ROI) on Innovation Efforts:** If the best ideas aren't consistently pursued, the overall return on investment in ideation and innovation initiatives diminishes.

Solving this problem now is critical to accelerate innovation cycles, ensure that the most promising ideas are identified and pursued, and maintain a competitive edge in a rapidly evolving market.

### Purpose and Value Proposition

The primary purpose of developing the 'Idea Ranking via Glicko-2 Algorithm' feature is to provide an efficient, objective, and reliable mechanism for evaluating and prioritizing a large volume of ideas. This solution aims to alleviate the current difficulties and time consumption associated with idea ranking by:

*   **Simplifying User Input:** Instead of requiring users to assign subjective absolute scores, the system will present a "gamified" approach where users are asked a simple question: "Which idea has higher potential?" (or another defined criterion) when presented with two ideas side-by-side <sup>[3](https://console.alisx.com/ideate/5c08b691-2dda-49e7-a6d0-d8174785e294/streams/332f01da-5d7d-4cfd-a2fd-71e2e630d3a9#:~:text=Instead%20of,higher%20potential%3F%22)</sup>. This reduces cognitive load, increases engagement, and makes the evaluation process more intuitive.
*   **Leveraging Robust Algorithms:** By applying the Glicko-2 algorithm, commonly used in chess rankings <sup>[3](https://console.alisx.com/ideate/5c08b691-2dda-49e7-a6d0-d8174785e294/streams/332f01da-5d7d-4cfd-a2fd-71e2e630d3a9#:~:text=This%20algorithm%2C,pairwise%20comparisons.)</sup>, the system will calculate a precise Rating for each idea based on its win/loss record in these pairwise comparisons <sup>[3](https://console.alisx.com/ideate/5c08b691-2dda-49e7-a6d0-d8174785e294/streams/332f01da-5d7d-4cfd-a2fd-71e2e630d3a9#:~:text=calculates%20a,pairwise%20comparisons.)</sup>.
*   **Providing Confidence Metrics:** Crucially, the Glicko-2 algorithm also calculates a Ratings Deviation (RD), which represents the confidence level in that rating <sup>[3](https://console.alisx.com/ideate/5c08b691-2dda-49e7-a6d0-d8174785e294/streams/332f01da-5d7d-4cfd-a2fd-71e2e630d3a9#:~:text=Crucially%2C%20it,that%20rating)</sup>. A low RD means the rating is more stable and reliable <sup>[3](https://console.alisx.com/ideate/5c08b691-2dda-49e7-a6d0-d8174785e294/streams/332f01da-5d7d-4cfd-a2fd-71e2e630d3a9#:~:text=A%20low,and%20reliable.)</sup>, enabling decision-makers to have greater trust in the prioritization outcomes and make more informed choices.
*   **Aligning with Strategic Goals:** This initiative directly supports the overall product vision and company goals of fostering innovation, optimizing resource allocation, and accelerating the development of high-impact solutions by ensuring that the most promising ideas are consistently identified and advanced.

This feature will transform the idea evaluation process from a burdensome task into an engaging and data-driven activity, ensuring that valuable insights are not lost in the volume of ideas.
